          Mega Panalo Agent – MegaPanalo Agent Login Guide & Commission Review
        </h1>
        <img src="/images/agent/02.jpg" alt="" title="" />
        <p>
          The Mega Panalo agent program’s reputation has reached its peak now in
          the Philippines. Everybody knows what a MegaPanalo’s agent stands for,
          goes to their job inquiry speech, swipes through TikTok videos that
          talk about their commission, and now you are, or you were, genuinely
          curious about it. Fortunately, we have everything here just about
          right.
        </p>
        <p>
          The following paragraphs contain steps of agent signing up and logging
          in, how their agent system works, review of their commission structure
          review as well as the solutions. Information mentioned majorly is
          going to be exclusive and first-handed, definitely something you’d
          never heard of. While you are relying on their agent program, you’re
          advised to read about the introduction and see what’s on the table.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are already an agent, you might also want to stop by and
          re-examine the resources you lack to take advantage of. Especially
          that the COVID-19 epidemic caused such economic damage and millions
          are impacted, earning yourself emergent usage is somehow important
          right now. You can certainly make more money reading this, experienced
          or not.
        </p>
        <h2>How to Login as a Mega Panalo Agent</h2>
        <img src="/images/agent/03.jpg" alt="" title="" />
        <p>
          To become an agent, you are required to contact the agents first.
          Usually, the agents are your soon-to-be upline, and you are mandatory
          to be their sub-agent. There’s no other way to make yourself more
          independent than that. However, the upside about it is that you will
          get useful tutorials from them, because your income directly affects
          theirs, so spending time on you meets your mutual goal.
        </p>
        <p>
          When your demand reaches, you are going to need to prepare a username
          for them. The username cannot be the same as your
          <a href="https://megapanalo.ph/" class="text-link">Mega Panalo</a>’s
          username if you already have one, and obeys the same rule as username
          registration (6-13 alphanumeric characters, non-case-sensitive). Your
          password will be provided after your username is considered alright.
          The first login requires you to change your password, which must
          follow the rule (6-12 alphanumeric characters, non-case-sensitive) as
          well.
        </p>
        <p>
          After changing your password, it’s still a challenge to find and
          differentiate your Account Center and Agent Center. Keep in mind that
          the account your upline opens for you has two identities, one is the
          identity of a casual player, the other is the agent. You can play
          games and earn a jackpot like every member does, but you have
          exclusive access to the Agent Center.
        </p>
        <img src="/images/agent/04.png" alt="" title="" />
        <p>
          The Agent Center located on the top of the
          <a href="https://megapanalo.ph/" class="text-link">home page</a>, it
          only shows up when you stay signed in.
        </p>
        <img src="/images/agent/05.png" alt="" title="" />
        <p>
          Various functions can be found here. Announcement, Overview, Account,
          Team Management, Team Betting, User Profit and Loss, My Income,
          Transaction Details, Dividend. The center meets your needs on a
          certainty, necessary data is all here. It’s a multitasking dashboard
          for agents, crucial to keep track of your statistical performance.
        </p>
        <p>Trouble signing in? The next paragraph might give you some hints.</p>
        <h2>MegaPanalo’s Agent System Review</h2>
        <img src="/images/agent/06.jpg" alt="" title="" />
        <p>
          Their agent system adapts the usual method like most online casinos
          do, your commission mainly comes from active players and sub-agents.
          You can opt one out of two salary structures, weekly paid and monthly.
          Weekly pay is the one people are familiar with, you are able to gain
          commission based on your performance; monthly paid is entirely
          different, your salary is fixed, but specific data performance must
          reach. Monthly pay agent works as a full-time job, you don’t get
          cut-offs for surplus performance. It’s not recommended if you are
          aiming for big money.
        </p>
        <p>
          From their propaganda, you can see that there is a threshold to become
          an agent, requirements as below:
        </p>
        <ol class="text-bold">
          <li>3 active players</li>
          <li>6 active sub-agents</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          The definition of ‘active’ according to them is to deposit 100 pesos
          and bet 100 pesos above, being the minimum turnover is 101 pesos. What
          does that stand for? Whether you’re finding players or sub-agents,
          it's mandatory for them to deposit and bet about the amount to reach
          the threshold. Though the requirements are separated, they are
          replaceable towards each other. 2 active players plus 4 sub-agents is
          viable, as long as the number is adding up to 6. Their requirements
          are strict compared to others.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you ever pay attention to Mega Panalo’s agent rule, you’ll find
          there’s a deduction. Chances are your downline wins a jackpot and you
          have to actually pay for their winnings.
        </p>
        <img src="/images/agent/07.png" alt="" title="" />
        <p>
          Did you see the problem here? Sub-agent gets a negative, and MA (Major
          Agent) gets a zero. Sub-agents bear the winnings from their downline,
          they have to pay the casino because of an uncontrollably fortune
          dropping off. Imagine you have to pay for a random stranger’s luck,
          and you are in-debt because of that. Besides, a MA’s commission has no
          commission to gain, it’s not fair at all.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another thing to notice is their commission share. It’s not mentioned
          in their propaganda or advertisement, because the proportion is
          relatively low, which goes around 30%. Not just that, membership
          distribution in MegaPanalo is mostly agents, it’s even exaggerated to
          say that the actual players occupy 10% of the casino. Behind the
          scenes, your profit is actually low because of actual players’
          shortage. You are already a sub-agent when registering, what else
          could you possibly expect? Well, there is. If you’re already an agent
          trying to sign in, you’ll find yourself unable to do that. The
          website’s login system is currently challenged by technical issues.
        </p>
        <h2>A Better Agent Program Than Mega Panalo</h2>
        <img src="/images/agent/08.jpg" title="" alt="" />
        <p>
          Mega Panalo Casino is not the only one who’s looking for agents, every
          online casino does. A professional agent should always care about the
          commission and membership distribution, weighing all the options on
          hand. Getting blindly influenced by and refusing to step out of your
          comfort zone is dangerous. Bet this is the first time you get to know
          how the whole system works, and thinking about that the system is
          actually arguable.

          If you find yourself having a hard time profiting from it, you should
          consider a plan B. The plan B recommended to you has higher
          commission, lower threshold, better agent system structure, reasonable
          membership proportion and receives a good reputation from the
          Philippines.

          has been plowing the Philippine market for years, sharing appreciation
          among experienced gamblers. The prerequisite for a Filipino to
          actually trust and devote their money into an online casino is quite
          simple: paying out or not. A legit casino cashes out despite the
          amount, and does it fast. You are not getting explained away for
          ridiculous reasons like “transaction verification” or “banking service
          delay”, you earn what you win. Simple.
        </p>
        <p>
          Philippine gamblers value trustworthiness, agents care about their
          commission and threshold. Let’s put it this way: it’s absolutely
          possible for you to earn tens of thousands of pesos weekly. Hawkplay’s
          reputation draws quality players, and they play a major part in its
          membership distribution. Quick reminder, your commission entirely
          bonds to your downline’s contribution, so yes, the member’s
          distribution and quality do matter.
        </p>
        <h2>Join Hawkplay: Best Agent Commission in the Philippines</h2>
        <img src="/images/agent/09.jpg" alt="" title="" />
        <p>
          Hawkplay offers a topmost of 45% commission, low threshold. To avoid
          the circumstances that the agents occupy most of the member base, the
          sub-agent system is not specially mentioned in their requirement. The
          only threshold to become an agent is to have 3 active players, your
          commission share goes to 45% when net loss and active player’s amount
          reach to a certain point.
        </p>
        <p>
          What’s the best part? You don’t pay for downline’s winnings. No matter
          how much they “unfortunately” win, Hawkplay absorbs the bill for you.
          You are officially free of the burden, no longer need to take the
          responsibility of unpredictable win.
        </p>
        <p>
          The quality and populous players in the casino assure you to earn
          commission a lot more. Agent’s commission share is based on the amount
          of downline’s net loss, a same share could perform very differently
          over your downline. You can have 3 active players whose total loss of
          a week to be 1,000 pesos, or 1 active player to have a ₱25,000,000 net
          loss a day. And that my friend, in fact happened in Hawkplay. A young
          lad won ₱25,000,000 on

            >Evolution Baccarat</a
          >. If a player is able to win such an amount, losses of the same are
          fairly possible. A 45% share earns you ₱11,250,000 in one single day.

                  In fact you do. You may consider yourself a MA (Major Agent),
